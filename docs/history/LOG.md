# History log

Chronological record for `krishanraja/ai-harness`. Newest first. The steward
rolls entries out of `NOW.md`'s "What changed recently" into this file when they
pass 30 days, and adds a line whenever a document is superseded, banners or
moved. Nothing here is ever rewritten.

## 2026-09-09

- reconciled at `f5b6d3d`: NOW.md rewritten against 27 non-steward commits since
  `f98ef85`, the head it was last reconciled against. Covered: the judge gate
  becoming blocking, three unrouted skills routed, the
  OpenClaw VPS declared a permanent heartbeated surface, `brain/rules.yaml`
  giving every canon rule a provenance record, `brain/decisions.jsonl`
  replacing a Supabase store that never existed, and four credentials found
  still live despite being reported rotated. No document moved and no
  contradiction needed resolving; this was drift correction on one file.

## 2026-09-08

- SURFACE installed `v2026.09.08.2` with 29 of 29 per-skill hashes and the
  139-file release aggregate matching. The first full Codex canary sheet was
  recorded as a failure rather than corrected to expectation.
- Machine release work moved into `scripts/Invoke-HarnessSync.ps1` and the
  `Mindmake AI Harness Sync` Windows Scheduled Task. It plans before applying,
  passes the previous deployment record, stops on unknown drift, verifies direct
  manifest parity, records observable canaries, opens an evidence pull request
  and sends a cloud heartbeat. Cursor canaries remain manual.
- The reconciler and the harness audit added (`scripts/reconcile.mjs`,
  `scripts/audit-harness.mjs`), both wired into `harness-steward.yml` nightly.
  The reconciler writes only through pull requests and never overwrites an edit
  made inside the markers; the audit never writes at all.
- Proposal issue #3 opened and resolved the same day: a block edit in
  `contentarchives` widening the secrets rule to cover commit messages and issue
  and pull request bodies. Resolved as option 1, the edit belonging in the canon
  rather than in one copy of it, so `contract/templates/canon-block.md` carries
  it and all ten surfaces re-render.
- `NOW.md` corrected. It had claimed trigger accuracy read `unmeasured` for all
  29 skills, inherited from a plan document rather than read from the registry.
  The registry carries `evaluation_evidence` for `n8n-operator` and
  `instantly-operator` only, while 19 per-skill result files from 2026-08-05 sit
  in `state/` and were never folded in.
- `NOW.md` and this log created. ai-harness joined the docs steward fleet as its
  ninth repository (`control-center` `docs/steward/fleet.json`), so the canon is
  maintained the same way it asks every other repository to be maintained. The
  registry is registered as a truth file: read, never written.

  Two entries rolled out of `NOW.md` on creation because they were already past
  the 30 day window:

## 2026-08-07

- Design-intelligence search evaluated and deliberately narrowed to a
  manual-only, read-only subordinate of `krish-design`, with the upstream
  installer, auto-trigger language and generic stack authority suppressed
  (`state/design-intelligence-search-evaluation-2026-08-07.md`,
  `state/import-review-ui-ux-pro-max-2026-08-07.md`).

## 2026-08-05

- The curated set was established: independent per-skill evaluations across 18
  skills, a quality readiness matrix, and the first release proof
  (`state/quality-readiness-matrix-2026-08-05.md`,
  `state/release-proof-2026-08-05.md`).
